# CAMEC
Conductive Additive Manufacturing for Electroplated Circuits (CAMEC) refers to what is a currently a research concept centered on using conductor-impregnated photopolymer 3D resins as a substrate for guided electroplating/electroforming to create low-cost, high-performance circuits with a high degree of electrical and mechatronic design freedom.
